I am a Ph.D. student in the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Princeton University. I enjoy the process of discovering and understanding. Climate dynamics is my general research interest. Currently, I am working with my advisor Prof. [Gabriel Vecchi](https://vecchi.princeton.edu/) on cloud feedback and climate sensitivity.
