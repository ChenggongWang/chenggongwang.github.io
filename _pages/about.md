I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://aos.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, with a strong passion for climate science and the power of numerical simulations to unlock new insights. My current research, under the guidance of Prof.[Gabriel Vecchi](https://vecchi.princeton.edu/) focuses on cloud feedback and climate sensitivityâ€”key factors in understanding the future of Earth's climate. Previously, I investigated the dynamics of the Hadley circulation and its expansion in collaboration with Prof. Yongyun Hu and Xinyu Wen at Peking University.

I am also passionate about applying machine learning to address challenges in climate simulation. During a recent research internship at NVIDIA, I developed a Machine Learning Earth System Model, Ola, to extend the predictability of AI-based weather models to the seasonal timescale. By explicitly coupling machine learning-based atmosphere and ocean models, Ola simulates realistic equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves and shows promising skill in forecasting ENSO events. Impressively, Ola can generate a six-month forecast in under a minute using a single A100 GPU, offering a cost-efficient approach to long-range climate prediction. Further details can be found in our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.08632v1).
