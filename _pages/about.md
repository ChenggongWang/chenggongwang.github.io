I am a Ph.D. student in the [Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://aos.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. My interests lie in various aspects of climate science, and I am continually amazed by the insights we can gain from numerical simulations. Currently, I am working with my advisor Prof. [Gabriel Vecchi](https://vecchi.princeton.edu/) on cloud feedback and climate sensitivity. In the past, I have studied the Hadley circulation and its expansion with Prof. Yongyun Hu and Xinyu Wen at Peking University.

Recently, I completed a research internship at NVIDIA, where I built a Machine Learning Earth System Model (Ola) to extend the predictability of the artificial intelligence (AI) weather model to the subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) timescale. By explicitly coupling the ML atmosphere and ML ocean models, Ola simulates realistic equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves. We present initial evidence of skill in forecasting the ENSO. Ola is cost-efficient and can produce a 6-month forecast in under one minute on a single A100 GPU.  Please see the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.08632v1) for details.
