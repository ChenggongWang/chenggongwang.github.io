I am a Ph.D. student in the [Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://aos.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. The joys of discovering and understanding lead me here. Climate dynamics are my general research interest. Currently, I am working with my advisor Prof. [Gabriel Vecchi](https://vecchi.princeton.edu/) on cloud feedback and climate sensitivity. Previously, I have wroked on Hadley circulation and its expension with Prof. Yongyun Hu and Xinyu Wen at Perking University.
